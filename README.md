# Compositionality Ratings for Scientific Noun Compounds
This repository contains compositionality ratings for 200 noun compounds from scientific text, extracted from the Royal Society Corpus (RSC) with a view to occurrences over a broad historical timeframe. Values for head and modifier compositionality were rated separately on a 0-5 Likert scale. The ratings were collected via annotation crowd-sourcing platform Prolific in eight batches, each batch was judged by 15 annotators.

`compounds_annotated.csv` contains averaged ratings over all annotators, as used in the paper \[REDACTED\]. Annotators that answered with the same score to all elements in a batch were excluded from the averages, these are marked with "_excluded" in the file containing all individual annotators' ratings, `all_judgements_anon.csv`.
